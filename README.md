## 1. Project Overview

### **Purpose**    

The Colorado Secretary of State is responsible for elections, and an employee of the Board of Elections, Tom has requested that we assist him with providing election data analysis audit for a recent congressional race. 

Tom's request includes that we build the analysis and audit tools that would allow it to be automated, utilizing Python programming, with the goal to replace the current manual method of using Excel. An automated process would be used for analyzing election results for other future elections within the state.  

This report is a written summary analysis of the requested election audit, with the purpose to accurately and quickly report on election results using the provided data.  

### **Objectives**

The audit report is to present the:
  - voting volume counts 
  - vote counts per county 
  - vote counts per candidate
  - to visually show the election results for each candidate
  - to indicate the winning candidate.
