## 1. Project Overview

### **Purpose**    

The Colorado Secretary of State is responsible for its elections, and an employee of the Board of Elections, Tom, has requested our assistance with providing an election data analysis audit for a recent congressional race. 

Tom's request includes that we build analysis and audit tools that would allow his office to have an automated process utilizing Python programming. The goal for automation is to replace the current manual method of using Excel, improving the accuracy and quality of the elections results. An automated process would be used for analyzing election results for future elections within Colorado.  

This report is a written summary analysis of the requested election audit, with the purpose to report on election results using the provided data accurately and quickly.  

### **Objectives**

This Audit Report is to present the following results:
  - voting volume counts 
  - vote counts per county 
  - vote counts per candidate
  - visually show the election results for each candidate
  - to indicate the winning candidate.
